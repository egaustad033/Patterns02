My Scene is called Train.Unity

I added a particle system resembling smoke coming from the train.  

Blue capsule is forward.
Yellow capsule is stop.
Purple capsule is back. 
Green capsule is randomize.

There should be no red errors and should be working fine.

My user stories are in a text file lables UserStories.txt in the main folder.
